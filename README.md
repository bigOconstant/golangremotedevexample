2. Open up this folder in VSCode
3. The bottom right hand side should ask you if you want to reopen this in the container click yes
    
If it's your first time running it will take a few minutes to load because it needs to download the images and build them. to see the progress of this before you open it up in vscode go to the root project directory and type,

`docker-compose build` 

It will load faster the next time
